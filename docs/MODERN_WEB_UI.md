- Custom hooks for debouncing and localStorage
- Proper component separation and maintainable structure
- TypeScript-like development using Babel

#### **State Management**

- useState and useEffect for local component state
- useLocalStorage custom hook for filter persistence
- Proper cleanup and effect dependencies
- Optimized re-rendering with useMemo and useCallback

#### **API Integration**

- Clean API abstraction with error handling
- Proper loading states and error boundaries
- Debounced API calls to prevent excessive requests
- Caching for suggestions to improve performance

#### **CodeMirror Integration**

- Custom IFS Marble language mode for syntax highlighting
- Material-darker theme with custom marble-dark enhancements
- Full-featured editor with search, fold, and scroll functionality
- Proper mode detection based on file extensions

## üîå **API Endpoints**

### **Search API**: `GET /api/search`

```
query: string - Search query
limit: int - Maximum results (default: 20)
file_type: string - Filter by extension (.entity, .plsql, etc.)
module: string - Filter by IFS module
min_complexity: float - Minimum complexity score
max_complexity: float - Maximum complexity score
```

### **Suggestions API**: `GET /api/suggestions`

```
query: string - Partial query for suggestions
limit: int - Maximum suggestions (default: 8)
```

### **File Content API**: `GET /api/file-content`

```
path: string - Full file path to retrieve content
```

## üöÄ **Performance Optimizations**

1. **Debounced Searches**: Prevents excessive API calls while typing
2. **Suggestion Caching**: Server-side caching of frequent suggestions
3. **Lazy Loading**: File content loaded only when viewing files
4. **Optimized Rendering**: Proper React patterns to minimize re-renders
5. **Efficient Filtering**: Client-side filter state management with persistence

## üéØ **User Experience Improvements**

1. **Instant Feedback**: Real-time search with visual loading states
2. **Context-Aware Suggestions**: Type-specific suggestions with icons and context
3. **Rich Results**: Comprehensive result cards with metadata and previews
4. **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for power users
5. **Accessibility**: Focus states, ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation
6. **Progressive Enhancement**: Graceful degradation if JavaScript fails

## üì± **Mobile Responsiveness**

- Responsive search input that scales to screen size
- Touch-optimized buttons and interactive elements
- Adaptive layout for smaller screens
- Mobile-friendly modal overlays
- Optimized typography for mobile reading

## üé® **Visual Design System**

### **Color Palette**

- Primary: Blue (#3b82f6) for interactive elements
- Dark scale: Custom dark-50 to dark-950 for backgrounds
- Semantic colors: Red for errors, Green for success, etc.
- File type colors: Blue (entity), Green (plsql), Purple (client), etc.

### **Typography**

- Clean, modern font stack
- Proper hierarchy with font weights and sizes
- Code fonts for technical content
- Optimized line heights and spacing

### **Component Design**

- Consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale
- Rounded corners and subtle shadows
- Hover states with smooth transitions
- Visual feedback for all interactive elements

This modern web interface provides a significantly enhanced user experience compared to the previous implementation, with better performance, usability, and visual design while maintaining all the powerful search capabilities of the IFS Cloud MCP Server.
