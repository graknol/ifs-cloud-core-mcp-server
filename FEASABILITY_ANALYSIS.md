# Feasibility Analysis for Solo Developer Implementation

## 1. Search Quality Framework ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Highly Feasible)

**Human Involvement Needed: Minimal**

**Why it's feasible:**

- Start with just 10-20 test queries based on your own searches
- Build incrementally - add queries as you encounter search failures
- Automate metric calculation completely

**Implementation approach:**

```python
# Start simple - you can build this in 1-2 days
class SimpleEvaluator:
    def __init__(self):
        # Start with your own common searches
        self.test_queries = [
            ("customer order validation", ["CustomerOrder.plsql", "CustomerOrderHandling.client"]),
            ("invoice approval workflow", ["InvoiceApproval.plsql", "InvoiceHandling.client"]),
            # Add 5-10 more based on your experience
        ]

    def evaluate(self, search_engine):
        scores = []
        for query, expected_files in self.test_queries:
            results = search_engine.search(query)
            # Simple scoring: how many expected files in top 5?
            top_5_files = [r['path'] for r in results[:5]]
            score = sum(1 for f in expected_files if f in top_5_files) / len(expected_files)
            scores.append(score)
        return sum(scores) / len(scores)
```

**Time estimate:** 1-2 days initial setup, then 5 minutes to add each new test case

## 2. Ranking Balance (Diversity) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Very Feasible)

**Human Involvement Needed: None**

**Why it's feasible:**

- Pure algorithmic change - no training data needed
- Can tune quotas based on simple A/B testing with yourself
- Immediate measurable improvement

**Quick implementation:**

```python
def apply_simple_diversity(results, max_per_type=3):
    """Dead simple diversity - limit each file type to N results in top 10"""
    type_counts = {}
    diverse_results = []
    overflow = []

    for result in results:
        file_type = result['type']
        count = type_counts.get(file_type, 0)

        if len(diverse_results) < 10 and count < max_per_type:
            diverse_results.append(result)
            type_counts[file_type] = count + 1
        else:
            overflow.append(result)

    return diverse_results + overflow
```

**Time estimate:** 2-4 hours to implement and test

## 3. User Feedback Loops ‚≠ê‚≠ê (Challenging for Solo Dev)

**Human Involvement Needed: Significant**

**Challenges:**

- Needs multiple users for meaningful data
- Learning-to-rank models require 1000s of labeled examples
- You alone can't generate enough diverse feedback

**Pragmatic alternative:**

```python
class SoloDevFeedback:
    """Simplified feedback for single developer use"""
    def __init__(self):
        self.bad_results = []  # Track searches that didn't work

    def mark_bad_search(self, query: str, what_you_wanted: str):
        """When search fails, record what you were looking for"""
        self.bad_results.append({
            "query": query,
            "wanted": what_you_wanted,
            "timestamp": datetime.now()
        })

    def generate_ranking_rules(self):
        """Convert bad searches into simple rules"""
        # Analyze patterns in bad searches
        # Generate rules like "if query contains 'workflow', boost .plsql files"
        rules = []
        for bad in self.bad_results:
            # Simple pattern matching to create rules
            if "workflow" in bad["query"] and ".plsql" in bad["wanted"]:
                rules.append(("workflow", ".plsql", 2.0))  # term, file_type, boost
        return rules
```

**Time estimate:** 1 day setup, then ongoing lightweight tracking

## 4. Advanced ML Techniques

### 4a. Semantic Search ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Moderately Feasible)

**Human Involvement Needed: Minimal**

**Why it's feasible:**

- Pre-trained models (no training needed!)
- One-time embedding computation
- Significant quality improvement

**Implementation:**

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import faiss

class LightweightSemanticSearch:
    def __init__(self):
        # Use small, fast model
        self.model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')  # Only 80MB
        self.index = None

    def build_index(self, files):
        """One-time index building - can run overnight"""
        embeddings = []
        for file in files:
            # Just use file name + first 500 chars
            text = f"{file['name']} {file['content'][:500]}"
            embedding = self.model.encode(text)
            embeddings.append(embedding)

        # Use FAISS for fast similarity search
        self.index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(384)  # dimension of MiniLM
        self.index.add(np.array(embeddings))
```

**Time estimate:** 1 day implementation, overnight indexing

### 4b. Query Expansion ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Highly Feasible)

**Human Involvement Needed: Moderate (one-time setup)**

**Why it's feasible:**

- Build thesaurus incrementally as you search
- Can extract from existing IFS documentation
- Immediate impact on search quality

**Smart approach:**

```python
class AutoThesaurusBuilder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.thesaurus = {}

    def extract_from_code(self, files):
        """Automatically find synonyms from variable names"""
        term_cooccurrence = defaultdict(set)

        for file in files:
            # Find variable assignments like: customer_order = sales_order
            patterns = [
                r'(\w+)\s*=\s*(\w+)',  # assignments
                r'--\s*(\w+)\s*\(also known as\s*(\w+)\)',  # comments
            ]
            for pattern in patterns:
                matches = re.findall(pattern, file['content'], re.IGNORECASE)
                for term1, term2 in matches:
                    term_cooccurrence[term1.lower()].add(term2.lower())
                    term_cooccurrence[term2.lower()].add(term1.lower())

        return term_cooccurrence
```

**Time estimate:** 2-3 days for good coverage

### 4c. Cross-Reference Analysis ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Feasible)

**Human Involvement Needed: None**

**Why it's feasible:**

- Fully automated from code analysis
- One-time graph building
- No training data needed

**Time estimate:** 1-2 days implementation

## 5. Model Optimization ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Highly Feasible)

**Human Involvement Needed: None**

**Best approach for solo dev:**

```python
import torch
from pathlib import Path

def compress_model_for_distribution():
    """One-command model compression"""
    # Option 1: Quantization (easiest, 75% size reduction)
    model = torch.load('export.pkl')
    quantized = torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic(
        model, {torch.nn.Linear, torch.nn.LSTM}, dtype=torch.qint8
    )
    torch.save(quantized, 'export_quantized.pkl')  # ~30MB

    # Option 2: Split model into chunks for Git
    def split_file(filepath, chunk_size=25*1024*1024):  # 25MB chunks
        with open(filepath, 'rb') as f:
            chunk_num = 0
            while True:
                chunk = f.read(chunk_size)
                if not chunk:
                    break
                with open(f"{filepath}.part{chunk_num}", 'wb') as chunk_file:
                    chunk_file.write(chunk)
                chunk_num += 1
```

**Time estimate:** 2-3 hours to implement and test

## üìä Recommended Implementation Order

| Priority | Feature            | Days | Impact | Effort |
| -------- | ------------------ | ---- | ------ | ------ |
| 1        | Model Optimization | 0.5  | High   | Low    |
| 2        | Ranking Diversity  | 0.5  | High   | Low    |
| 3        | Simple Test Suite  | 2    | Medium | Low    |
| 4        | Query Expansion    | 3    | High   | Medium |
| 5        | Semantic Search    | 2    | High   | Medium |
| 6        | Cross-Reference    | 2    | Medium | Medium |
| 7        | Solo Feedback      | 1    | Low    | Low    |

**Total time: ~11 days of focused work**

## üí° Solo Developer Strategy

1. **Start with algorithmic improvements** (diversity, expansion) - no data needed
2. **Use pre-trained models** - avoid training completely
3. **Build test suite from your own searches** - you are your first user
4. **Automate everything possible** - code analysis, cross-references
5. **Skip user feedback initially** - not feasible without users

The key insight: Most improvements don't actually need large datasets or user feedback. Focus on the algorithmic and pre-trained model improvements first. You can achieve 80% of the benefit with 20% of the effort by choosing the right features to implement.
