# Local wheels

Sometimes the wheels we need are not on PyPI, and so we must download and install them manually.

For windows, I need the [prebuilt Flash Attention 2 wheel](https://github.com/petermg/flash_attn_windows/releases) as it's notoriously hard to build on Windows.

Download it and drop it in this folder, so that pyproject.toml finds it.
