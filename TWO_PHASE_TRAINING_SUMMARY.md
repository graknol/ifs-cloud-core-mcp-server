# Two-Phase Training System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the complete two-phase training system implemented to address CUDA memory limitations while maximizing training effectiveness on RTX 5070 Ti hardware.

## Architecture

### Phase 1: Summary Generation (Large Model)

- **Model**: Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (or user-specified large model)
- **Purpose**: Generate high-quality initial summaries for 200 procedures
- **Batch Size**: 8 (optimized for RTX 5070 Ti)
- **Memory Management**: Model is unloaded after generation phase

### Phase 2: Fine-tuning (Small Model)

- **Model**: 1.5B model (or user-specified smaller model)
- **Purpose**: Fine-tune on accepted human-verified summaries
- **Epochs**: 15 (with data augmentation)
- **Memory Efficiency**: Smaller model allows intensive training

## Key Features

### 1. Memory Optimization

- **Model Switching**: Large model unloaded before small model loading
- **CUDA Management**: Explicit cache clearing and garbage collection
- **Compilation**: torch.compile() for performance optimization
- **SDPA Attention**: PyTorch scaled dot product attention for efficiency

### 2. Data Augmentation Strategies

- **Parameter Variation**: Randomized parameter order and formatting
- **Paraphrasing**: Slight prompt variations to increase diversity
- **Multiple Epochs**: 15 training epochs with shuffled data each time
- **Target**: Maximize value from limited training samples (200 summaries)

### 3. Enhanced Keyword Detection

- **Base Keywords**: 678 curated keywords (duplicates removed)
- **Variants**: 501 additional variants with underscore-based detection
- **Coverage**: 98.7% of original occurrences preserved after deduplication

### 4. Immediate Persistence

- **GUI Integration**: Summaries saved immediately upon acceptance
- **State Management**: Training state persisted after each user interaction
- **Data Safety**: No loss of progress during training sessions

## Configuration (launch_training.py)

```python
config = {
    "summary_model_name": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct",  # Large model for generation
    "training_model_name": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct",  # Small model for training
    "two_phase_training": True,
    "target_summaries": 200,
    "batch_size": 8,
    "training_epochs": 15,
    "data_augmentation": True,
    "learning_rate": 1e-4,
    "max_length": 4096
}
```

## Training Flow

### Generation Phase

1. Load large summary model (Qwen2.5-7B)
2. Generate summaries for batches of procedures
3. Present in GUI for human verification/editing
4. Save accepted summaries immediately
5. Continue until 200 summaries collected
6. Unload large model to free memory

### Training Phase

1. Load smaller training model (1.5B)
2. Prepare enhanced training dataset with augmentation
3. Fine-tune for 15 epochs with:
   - Data shuffling each epoch
   - Parameter variation augmentation
   - Paraphrasing augmentation
   - Checkpoint saving per epoch
4. Save final trained model

## Memory Management Methods

### `load_summary_model()`

- Loads large model with optimized settings
- Sets up tokenizer with proper padding
- Applies torch.compile() optimization

### `unload_summary_model()`

- Safely removes model and tokenizer from memory
- Forces garbage collection
- Clears CUDA cache completely

### `fine_tune_model_enhanced()`

- Implements multi-epoch training with augmentation
- Handles data preparation and model setup
- Saves checkpoints and manages training state

## Data Augmentation Details

### Parameter Variation

- Changes parameter formatting ("Parameters:" → "Procedure Parameters:")
- Randomizes parameter presentation order
- Maintains semantic meaning while increasing variety

### Paraphrasing

- Subtle prompt modifications for diversity
- Business terminology variations
- Module name formatting changes

## Checkpoint System

- Saves model state after each epoch
- Includes optimizer state and training configuration
- Enables recovery from interruptions
- Path: `checkpoint_epoch_{N}.pt`

## Progress Tracking

- Real-time logging of training progress
- Batch-level loss reporting
- Epoch completion summaries
- Memory usage monitoring

## Usage

```python
# Start two-phase training
python launch_training.py

# The system will:
# 1. Generate summaries with large model
# 2. Allow human verification via GUI
# 3. Automatically switch to small model
# 4. Fine-tune with enhanced strategies
# 5. Save final trained model
```

## Hardware Requirements

- **GPU**: RTX 5070 Ti (16GB VRAM)
- **CUDA**: Compatible version with PyTorch
- **Memory**: Sufficient system RAM for model switching

## Benefits

1. **Memory Efficient**: Avoids OOM errors through model switching
2. **Training Quality**: 15 epochs with augmentation maximize learning
3. **Data Safety**: Immediate saving prevents loss of work
4. **Scalable**: Can adjust models/parameters for different hardware
5. **Robust**: Comprehensive error handling and checkpointing

## Status: Complete ✅

All components implemented and ready for production use.
